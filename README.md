## What is this, anyway?

This GitHub Repository contains my personal tips for doing all of the things listed above. None of these are intended
to be a comprehensive guide. I made them bc I've given advice for this stuff enough times that I decided to type it up. 
The intended audience for these tips are people who are doing the above things for their first time. There are probably 
other people more qualified to give you advice on this stuff, and I don't pretend to be an expert either. Also, some of 
these tips reflect my personal preferences, just so you know. You'll probably have different ones than me. Anyway, I'm 
hoping I can help you get started off on the right foot. LMK if there's anything you think I should add or change.
