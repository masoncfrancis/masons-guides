## What Is This?

This repository contains my personal tips for doing all of the things listed above. None of these are intended
to be a comprehensive guide. The intended audience for these tips are people who are doing the above things for 
their first time. I'm not the most qualified person to give you these tips, and I don't pretend to be an expert 
either. Also, some of these tips reflect my personal preferences, just so you know. You'll probably have different
ones. Regardless, I'm hoping I can help you get started off on the right foot. LMK if theres anything you think I 
should add to these.
