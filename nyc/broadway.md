# Broadway

This page will (hopefully) help you get broadway tickets for cheaper than full price. 

You can go ahead and look for deals online, but make sure to buy tickets directly from the production's website,
or from a reputable vendor like TodayTix. 

I recommend checking multiple seating sections when you're buying tickets ahead of time. Sometimes the front row
will have a lower price than seats behind them because the stage is really high up. Once I got Dear Evan Hansen 
front row seats for 50 bucks, and the seats behind me were more expensive. 

You can purchase tickets beforehand, but you can also a lot of times find deals on tickets for the same day.

## Same Day Tickets

I'm going to talk about these 3 ways to get cheaper broadway tickets: rush, lottery, and TKTS.

Pretty much all of these are for same day tickets, so you just need to plan out what shows you want to get cheap tickets for. Not every show does rush and lottery both, and some dont do anything at all for cheap tickets.

### Rush

Rush tickets are when you show up to the ticket office the day of the show you want to see and buy tickets 
they have for open seats that day. It's usually best to go in the morning, and you can buy tickets for 
pretty good discounts. This is the best way in my opinion. I got 3rd row seats to a show once for 40 bucks doing this.

Sometimes shows will do this digitally. I once bought same day discount tickets for Mrs. Doubtfire online
using the TodayTix app. 

### Lottery

Lottery is where you submit your name into an online lottery and then they shoot you an email if you won tickets 
for that day. Sometimes these can be super cheap. For example, as of this writing Hamilton does a daily lottery 
for 10 dollar tickets. You'll find the lottery for these on the show's website. There's usually a small lottery
entry window, so you have to be quick about it. Also, if you end up winning, you usually have a small time window
to claim the tickets you won. So again, you gotta stay on top of it if you are trying to get tickets this way. 

### TKTS

TKTS is a booth in Times Square under the big stairs and in Lincoln Center. You can buy same day tickets there 
for cheap, but its usually not as good of a deal as Rush and Lottery. But it's still probably going to be 
cheaper than buying from the show's website.
