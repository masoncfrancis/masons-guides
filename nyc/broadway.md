This page will (hopefully) help you get broadway tickets for cheaper than full price. 

I'm going to talk about these 3 ways to get cheaper broadway tickets: rush, lottery, and TKTS.

Pretty much all of these are for same day tickets, so you just need to plan out what shows you want to get cheap tickets for. Not every show does rush and lottery both, and some dont do anything at all for cheap tickets.

## Rush

Rush tickets are when you show up to the ticket office the day of the show you want to see, usually in the morning, and you can buy tickets for super good discounts. This is the best way in my opinion. I got 3rd row seats to a show once for 40 bucks doing this.

## Lottery

Lottery is where you submit your name into an online lottery and then they shoot you an email if you won tickets for the day. Sometimes these can be super cheap. For example, as of this writing Hamilton does a daily lottery for 10 dollar tickets.

## TKTS

TKTS is a booth in Times Square under the stairs and in Lincoln Center. You can buy same day tickets there for cheap, but its usually not as good of a deal as Rush and Lottery.
