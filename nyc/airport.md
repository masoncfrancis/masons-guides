# Getting To/From The Airport

This section will help you figure out how to travel between Manhattan and the airport. How to get there depends
on which airport you are flying in/out of. 

Unless you want to pay a lot of money, **do not** take a taxi or Uber/Lyft to or from the airport. They're crazy expensive.
If you take train and/or bus, you'll pay between 3-10 dollars. If you take a taxi/Uber/Lyft, you're probably looking at upwards
of 50 bucks. 

I personally recommend using Google Maps to help you get to your specific destination, and which train/bus to take. For information
on how to get around once you're in Manhattan, read my [Getting Around](gettingaround.md) page. 

There are three airports around New York City:

* John F Kennedy (JFK)
* LaGuardia (LGA)
* Newark (EWR)

## John F Kennedy (JFK)

To get to Manhattan from JFK, you'll be taking a series of trains. 

The first train is at the airport. It's called the AirTrain. The AirTrain goes between terminals at the airport
and also connects you to the subway system. There are two AirTrains you need to know about. One goes to the Jamaica 
subway station, and the other goes to the Howard Beach subway station. You can use either to get into Manhattan. If 
you're staying in Queens, it's probably better to take the Jamaica one. If you're staying in Brooklyn, probably take 
the Howard Beach one. If you're staying in Manhattan, it doesn't matter because both will take you where you need to go.

Once you get to the Jamaica or Howard Beach station, you'll need to pay fares as you exit the AirTrain station and enter 
the subway station. The AirTrain fare is $8.25, and you have to pay for it using a MetroCard (see [Getting Around](gettingaround.md)).
Subway fare is $2.75, and you can pay that with a MetroCard or by tapping your card/phone on the OMNY reader (see
[Getting Around](gettingaround.md) for more info).

You need to make sure you're getting on the subway train headed in the right direction.If you're at the Jamaica station, 
make sure to follow signs for the ![E train logo](img/e.png), ![J train logo](img/j.png), or ![Z train logo](img/z.png)
trains toward Manhattan as shown in the map above. You can use Google Maps to figure out which one is best for where you
want to go. **Do not** get on a train for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). If you're at the Howard Beach station, you'll 
need to follow signs for the ![A train logo](img/a.png) train going towards Brooklyn and Manhattan, **not** towards the 
Rockaways. 

To go back to JFK, you'll need to make sure to get back off the subway and onto the AirTrain at either Howard Beach or Jamaica 
stations. It doesn't matter which one you choose if you're going to the airport.
