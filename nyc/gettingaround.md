# Getting Around

Getting around in NYC is way different than getting around where you live. You don't need a car, and it's actually a hassle to have one.

## Good Stuff To Know

## Cars

Don't rent one. Parking in NYC is awful and you're looking at upwards of $120 per day just for parking. Also, you don't want to deal with New York
traffic or tolls. 

## Taxis, and Ubers/Lyfts

Don't use them unless you are stranded somewhere not near the subway or you feel like you are in danger, especially on a bus or subway. They cost 
a lot more than you probably wanna pay, tbh. Plus if you're trying to use a taxi you have to try to flag one down, which kinda sucks. 

## Ferry

You can use the NYC Ferry system to get to some places around New York. The ferry fare is $4 and can give you a good view of the NYC skyline. I definitely 
wouldn't try to use the ferry as your main way of getting around, but it's worth trying out for an experience. You can see routes, locations, and times at 
[ferry.nyc](https://www.ferry.nyc/).

Separate from the NYC Ferry system is the Staten Island Ferry which departs every 30 minutes from South Ferry, is free, and will take you to Staten Island.
Personally, though, I wouldn't bother to visit Staten Island on your first trip to NYC. Or on your second time. Or any time really. There's not much there. 
But now you know about it if you want. The Staten Island Ferry is a way to get a view of the Statue of Liberty, though. But if you do that make sure the
weather is good. You probably also should know it's not an up close view, but it is a view, and it is free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
