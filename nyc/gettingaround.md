# Getting Around

Getting around in NYC is way different than getting around where you live. You don't need a car, and it's actually a hassle to have one.

## Good Stuff To Know

Before I tell you how to get around, there are a couple things you need to know about New York.

New York is broken into 5 boroughs:

* Manhattan (where all the skyscrapers are, where you'll spend most of your time)
* The Bronx (cool, also known for being rough)
* Queens (where LaGuardia and JFK are)
* Brooklyn (south of Queens, has some interesting stuff)
* Staten Island (mostly residential, boring, can only get to it by ferry)

You'll probably spend most of your time in Manhattan. Going north in Manhattan is referred to as going "uptown". Going south in Manhattan
is referred to as going "downtown". You need to know this so you can make sure to get on trains and buses going in the right direction. 

## The Subway

The main way to get around NYC is on the subway. In Manhattan, every subway station is underground. In Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, some
of them are above ground. 

### What The Colored Numbers and Letters Mean

The subway station is organized into colored lines, with specific train routes being designated by numbers or letters. There are reasons for that, 
but it's kind of complicated. Ask me sometime if you want to know. Within a colored line, not all trains stop at all stations. For example, in 
Manhattan the A train is considered an 'express' train and doesn't stop at all stops but runs along mostly the same route as the C and E trains
(with exceptions). I recommend using Google Maps to help you figure out which train to take so you can get off where you need to. You can also find
the subway map [here](https://new.mta.info/map/5256). The little letters and numbers next to each stop show which trains stop there. 

### How To Pay Your Fare

## Cars

Don't rent one. Parking in NYC is awful and you're looking at upwards of $120 per day just for parking. Also, you don't want to deal with New York
traffic or tolls. 

## Taxis, and Ubers/Lyfts

Don't use them unless you are stranded somewhere not near the subway or you feel like you are in danger, especially on a bus or subway. They cost 
a lot more than you probably wanna pay, tbh. Plus if you're trying to use a taxi you have to try to flag one down, which kinda sucks. 

## Ferry

You can use the NYC Ferry system to get to some places around New York. The ferry fare is $4 and can give you a good view of the NYC skyline. I definitely 
wouldn't try to use the ferry as your main way of getting around, but it's worth trying out for an experience. You can see routes, locations, and times at 
[ferry.nyc](https://www.ferry.nyc/).

Separate from the NYC Ferry system is the Staten Island Ferry which departs every 30 minutes from South Ferry, is free, and will take you to Staten Island.
Personally, though, I wouldn't bother to visit Staten Island on your first trip to NYC. Or on your second time. Or any time really. There's not much there. 
But now you know about it if you want. The Staten Island Ferry is a way to get a view of the Statue of Liberty, though. But if you do that make sure the
weather is good. You probably also should know it's not an up close view, but it is a view, and it is free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
