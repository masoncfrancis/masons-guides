# Arriving in NYC by Train

**This file is incomplete**

Depending on where you are in the US, you can also get to NYC by train instead of plane. 

There are multiple train services that serve NYC: Amtrak, MTA Metro-North, MTA Long Island Rail Road, and NJ Transit

## Amtrak

Amtrak is your go to if you're looking for long distance routes. It may be cheaper than flying, but it might not be the cheapest of these train options. It does serve more locations though.
