# Arriving in NYC by Train

Depending on where you are in the US, you can also get to NYC by train instead of plane. 

There are multiple train services that serve NYC: Amtrak, MTA Metro-North, MTA Long Island Rail Road, and NJ Transit

## Amtrak

Amtrak is your go to if you're looking for long distance routes. It's not the cheapest option, but it serves a lot more places than the other three.
