# Stuff To Do

I originally wanted to title this section "Stuff To Do That Isn't Broadway" but I decided not to bc not 
everyone is as into Broadway as I am, sadly ðŸ˜¢

My opinion is that what you want to do in NYC should totally be based on your preferences. These are a few things
to do that I've enjoyed, but 

I'm still working on putting more stuff here

## Museums

* [9/11 Memorial](https://www.911memorial.org/visit/visit-museum-1) (I can't recommend this one enough, plus it has student discounts)
* [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://engage.metmuseum.org/admission)
* [New York Transit Museum](https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/visit/) (in an old subway station in Brooklyn)

## Food

### Max Brenner

Probably my favorite food place in NYC. It's a chocolate themed restaurant. It's a little pricey, but so good.
