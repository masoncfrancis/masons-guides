## What is this, anyway?

This GitHub repository contains my personal tips for doing the stuff in the title for the first time. I made it bc I've given 
advice for this enough times that I decided to type it up. It's not intended to be a comprehensive guide. I don't pretend 
to be an expert, I just love train travel and love telling people about it. Also, some of these tips reflect my personal preferences,
just so you know. You'll probably have different ones than me. Anyway, I'm hoping I can help you get started off on the right foot. 
LMK if there's anything you think I should add or change.
