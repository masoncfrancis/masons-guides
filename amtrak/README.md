## What is this, anyway?

This GitHub Repository contains my personal tips doing the stuff in the title for the first time. I made it bc I've given 
advice for this enough times that I decided to type it up. It's not intended to be a comprehensive guide. I'm probably not 
the most qualified person to give you advice on this stuff, and I don't pretend to be an expert either. Also, some of 
these tips reflect my personal preferences, just so you know. You'll probably have different ones than me. Anyway, I'm 
hoping I can help you get started off on the right foot. LMK if there's anything you think I should add or change.
